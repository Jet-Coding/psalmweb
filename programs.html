					<h3>Evangelism</h3>
					<p>
						𝐍𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐆𝐨𝐬𝐩𝐞𝐥 𝐎𝐮𝐭𝐛𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐤 𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐜𝐡𝐞𝐬 𝟐,𝟐𝟐𝟓 𝐢𝐧𝐝𝐢𝐯𝐢𝐝𝐮𝐚𝐥𝐬 Glory to the Lord
						of the Harvest for the 2,225 individuals shared with the gospel,
						2040 of whom prayed to receive the Lord Jesus Christ during our
						National Gospel Outbreak from September 2-7, 2024. With 206 soul
						winners who participated, the gospel has been proclaimed in the
						campuses, parks, malls, boarding houses, workplaces, plazas and
						communities. Pray with us continually as our workers will be making
						necessary follow through for intentional discipleship.

					<h3>Caring Circle Lesson (CCL)</h3>
					<p>
						𝐃𝐈𝐒𝐂𝐈𝐏𝐋𝐈𝐍𝐆 𝐓𝐇𝐄 𝐘𝐎𝐔𝐓𝐇 𝐓𝐇𝐑𝐎𝐔𝐆𝐇 𝐒𝐏𝐎𝐑𝐓𝐒 When I transferred to PSALM Base
						in 2017, I desired to start a sports ministry where we can 𝙬𝙞𝙣 𝙨𝙤𝙪𝙡𝙨
						𝙖𝙣𝙙 𝙢𝙖𝙠𝙚 𝙙𝙞𝙨𝙘𝙞𝙥𝙡𝙚𝙨 because our HOME is very strategic. We started
						hosting Clash of Campuses where different teams from invited schools
						where PSALM Cebu was operating can play various games. Through these
						initiatives, students and professionals were shared with the gospel
						and many of them joined our Caring Circles. But it was short of a
						full blown sports ministry. Today, God answered our prayers through
						these young Caring Circle Graduates here in Talisay. With
						intentional disciple-making as our goal, we hope to launch 𝙋𝙎𝘼𝙇𝙈’𝙨
						𝙎𝙥𝙤𝙧𝙩𝙨 𝙈𝙞𝙣𝙞𝙨𝙩𝙧𝙮 in the months to come.

					<h3>Leadership Training (PLTI)</h3>
					<p>
						I am a PSALMista, committed to being an #EXEMPLARY servant leader.
						As 1 Timothy 4:12 says: "Let no one despise you for your youth, but
						set the believers an example in speech, in conduct, in love, in
						faith, in purity." Show your support for the upcoming PLTI-National
						2024 by using this caption and frame on your profile picture.

					<h3>Breakthrough Retreat (BR)</h3>
					<p>
						We can only boast of the power of the grace of God and the Holy
						Spirit's anointing! Another Breakthrough Retreat was conducted at
						Bayog, Zamboanga del Sur. It was through the Holy Spirit's working
						that breakthrough happened to the lives of the young people. With
						the help of the campus missionaries being the vessel, the students
						were ministered, counseled and encouraged to walk the light of truth
						Jesus brought to everyone. Breakthrough happens upon yielding to the
						God's will, Spirit's power and Jesus' grace into our lives.
